This is the README file for Term::VT102, a Perl module which provides
emulation of a VT102 terminal.

Like the "expect" Tcl extension, this module is intended primarily for use
as a way of automating processes; for instance, you can write a script which
connects via telnet to a full-screen service of some kind (such as
Monochrome BBS, http://www.mono.org/), uses this module to parse the output,
and therefore can tell what is currently "on the screen" and react
accordingly.  Expect cannot really do this, as it is stream-oriented, rather
than being able to tell you, say, what's on the top row of the screen.

For installation instructions, see the INSTALL file.

Term::VT102 was written by Andrew Wood <andrew.wood@ivarch.com>; send flames,
bug reports, conversation, and all that sort of thing in that direction.
