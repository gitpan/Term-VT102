This is the README file for Term::VT102, a Perl module which provides
emulation of a VT102 terminal.

Like the "expect" Tcl extension, this module is intended primarily for use
as a way of automating processes; for instance, you can write a script which
connects via telnet to a full-screen service of some kind (such as
Monochrome BBS, http://www.mono.org/), uses this module to parse the output,
and therefore can tell what is currently "on the screen" and react
accordingly.  Expect cannot really do this, as it is stream-oriented, rather
than being able to tell you, say, what's on the top row of the screen.

For installation instructions, see the INSTALL file.

Please send bug reports, comments, and so on to the project maintainer, Andrew
Wood <andrew.wood@ivarch.com>.
